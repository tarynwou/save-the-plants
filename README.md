You live in the village Crestwood in the heart of Veil. The kingdom of Veil is of a prosperous yet sustainable type—the entire kingdom’s source of food is provided by the 7 sacred “Fergle Plants”. Crestwood is a place of serenity and politeness. This morning, however, you were awakened to the sound of frantic knocking at your door. The person was gone by the time you opened your door.

Whoever it was had left this newsletter at your front step.

“THE CREST OF VEIL
Sometime during the night, the town’s most valuable possessions, the ‘Fergle Plants’ were stolen from the royal garden by a malevolent wizard. He has since taken over the tower and is taking pleasure in starving the town. The king has sent out all of his most skilled kingsmen soon after the incident to retrieve the ‘Fergle Plants’ and defeat the beast, but none of them have returned since. The King has announced a huge reward to whoever can get to the castle tower, defeat the wizard, and save the vital plants to save the town.”

You, a humble and ethical individual passionate about the welfare of your family, friends, and neighbours, have decided to embark on your quest to save the “Fergle Plants” and save the town. You will have to travel through the purple forest to get to the castle, so prepare yourself by loading up on goodies and seeking advice from the townspeople.

Don’t get too distracted by chatting up the village, you have a quest to endeavour on! Get to the castle to defeat the wizard! The time is ticking my friend!
